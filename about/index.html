Over the years, I have had experience working with individuals of all ages and intellectual needs and it has helped me learn how to dedicate and prioritize my time to best suit the needs of the individual.</h3>
              <h3>I have hobbies: I love reading, I paint quirky watercolour prints, I play slopitch softball (not well, but not the point), traveling and I like playing around with web design and open source graphic software.</h3>

              <!-- <h3>I was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The oldest of three girls, I always enjoyed being the role model and leader and even from a young age, I wanted to show my sisters that there was more to being a girl than makeup and dolls. I was not a tomboy: I was not good at sports, I didn't like video games, I wanted to be a teacher when I grew up and I listened to the Spice Girls just like everyone else. I wanted to be different, but I wasn't and that was okay. </h3> -->
              <!-- <h3>It wasn't until high school where I realized that trying to pierce the world of technology was going to be challenging: I was the only girl who took computer science, and that statistic followed into university where I was often outcasted as the only girl who was there on her own. </h3> -->

              <h2 class="h2Box">Educational Philosophy</h2>
              <h3>I am lucky that two of my passions - English literature and Computer Science - are what I consider the building blocks for many of our students futures because they help develop key skills and confidence that filters over into all aspects of their lives. Communication and adaptability are key components of successful learning and developing confidence. Teaching English doesn't have to be about exploring the story - but a catalyst for effective and meaningful communication. Technology is the future: our young people should have the skills and confidence in technology so that they feel relevant and competitive in any field they choose to pursue.</h3>
