              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>My name is Samantha-Rae Adamson and I was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I went to a French immersion high school before began my studies at the University of Manitoba, where I explored my interests in literature, computer programming, the sociology of the family and native studies.</p>
              <p>I got my Bachelor of Arts degree in 2013, majoring in English and minoring in Sociology. I then entered the Faculty of Education to teach senior years English and Computer Science.</p>
              <p>After graduating, I spent the last few months of the school year subsitute teaching in River East Transcona, where I spent all of my school years and both practicums, and Sunrise School division. I then made the big decision to move abroad to London, England, where I taught in a variety of schools across Southwest London before taking an English position in an all girls Secondary school.</p>
              <p>There, I spent 7 months teaching girls between the ages of 11 and 16. These young ladies came from a wide variety of cultures, many coming from all over the world and just learning English for the first time. They were bright, colourful and lively students and the experience was both challenging and humbling.</p>
              <p>However, after a year away from home, I've decided to come back to Winnipeg. Teaching abroad has taught me a lot about myself as a teacher and a person; it has reminded me that diversity is empowering, education is the way to a bright future, and Winnipeg is my home. I am certain that I want to spend my time empowering the diverse voices that make up our city. </p>

              <h2>My Education Story</h2>
              <p>I am aware that English and Computer Science are an odd combination for teachable subjects, but I am a bit of an odd combination.</p>
              <p>I enjoy reading, I think web design is a fun passtime (this website is an example of what I do in my free time), I paint to relax and make </p>

              <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
              <p>I can say I read in my spare time, which is true, but it's not interesting to talk about. I love all sorts of books, but I tend to read books I think will interest young readers to keep me up to date for my recommendations, so there's that.</p>
              <p>A little more interesting hobby of mine is web design- I made this website you're currently looking at! This one isn't particularly flashy, but my goal was to showcase and create good website bones to demonstrate building skills for my students.</p>
              <p>I also enjoy painting and drawing. Hand made signs and cartoon art are my favourites.</p>
